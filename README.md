# Classification Examples with Pytorch

In this repository, I prepared classification models using Pytorch on tabular data. I grouped the projects based on the number of classes and labels they contain. As you can easily see when you examine, even though I worked on different data sets, I applied the same methods and used almost the same codes except for separating data into target and variable using data visualization. The models I used contain the most basic steps that can be applied in classification operations on tabular data. I tried to write as short and concise as possible.

The operations I've done are simple and suitable for almost any tabular dataset, and are useful examples for their type of classification. Thus, after changing the dataset and initially setting the properties of the target and variables, the rest of the code will adapt to each project.
